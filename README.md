# Deepfake Detection

This project is a custom-built deepfake detection system that uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**, enhanced with handcrafted features such as **Local Binary Patterns (LBP)** and **Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)**. An **attention mechanism** improves focus on key facial regions.

### Features
- CNN-based classification
- Feature extraction with LBP & DCT
- Attention mechanism to improve accuracy
- Jupyter Notebook based implementation

### Requirements
